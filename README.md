# BetterFurnaceCart
*A minecraft spigot plugin for faster furnace carts*

Are you tired of your regular old minecarts? Well, let me introduce you to the world of **Steam Powered Locomotion!** If you're not already aware in Minecraft Furnace carts can be powered with coal/charcoal to move along tracks carrying up to 3 minecarts behind it. This is achieved using the "shunting" method (where minecarts are pressed together). The main problem however is the speed limitation of this form of transport.

A Furnace cart will move slower than a player can run. So this plugin works to fix that by making steam-powered high-speed rail a reality! If you want long trains that run several times faster than normal sticky-powered rail trains, then check this plugin out!
